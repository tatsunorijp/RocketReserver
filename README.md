# Rocket Reserver

**Rocket Reserver** is a personal project developed with the primary goal of gaining in-depth knowledge of GraphQL and the Apollo iOS framework.

In this iOS application, users can view a list of upcoming rocket launches and have the option to make or cancel a reservation for the selected rocket.

# What I've learned

Through this project, I acquired a solid understanding of key concepts such as executing queries, mutations, and subscriptions using Apollo iOS. Additionally, I learned how to configure the Apollo framework from scratch, including downloading the schema from the source API and generating the necessary operation files.
